"DO NOT GO HERE!!!!  FILTHY STORE DISGUSTING .Handled food with no gloves no mask. Very rude employees let only male customers in the restaurant. Went to pick up order and was rudely kicked out explained was there for an order and was told to bad go threw the drive thru . Went to the drive thru 15 cars in line and when I left unlocked the doors and let only make customers in.all the while my customer is waiting for there food . Listening to other orders and restaurant is out of everything. What a disappointment. Still in line over a half an hour. I can't even give them one star not even for effort none was giving. This isn't the first time I've gone here and Evey order was messed up or they didn't have the food. Where is the Management please for the love of God HELP KFC  in Canandaigua, N.Y.",Jennifer G,"Derby, NY",3
Not as good as cluckin' bell's chicken but not bad either,Lamar D.,"Roselle, IL",3
The service is trashy they throw the order at you and the wait is horrible I love this food but that's beside the point this needs to change.,EMS L.,"Greensburg, PA",1
"Yeah the dining area could look a lot cleaner.

But I've been here several times for both KFC and Taco Bell food and have never gotten sick so that's an a-ok in my book.
I forget the cashier's name I've met several times, she's actually pretty nice and friendly.
There is NO drive through. The dining room can be filled with sketchy people sometimes. Sometimes, it's families.","

"With arbitrary tip, fees and taxes KFC wants to charge $45 for a $30 fill up. Free delivery. Ridiculous to assume that one would want to pay a 20% tip for no table service.
On top of that, they left the dipping sauce out of the bag. Took an hour to reach them to complain and by then the food was gone.
So I fell for the advertisements and tried it once. Never again.",Blair C.,"San Francisco,CA",1
"Once a year we indulge in a chicken meal. Ordered the $20 Family bucket today. First, the lethargic clerk told us they were out of white meat.  Okay, we actually prefer dark meat, but still not excusable to not have your standard, advertised product. Then she tells us there is no extra crispy because they ran out of breading. How can a KFC franchise run out of breading? That's what they do. They bread and deep fry chicken.  
We decided after driving over there we would live with that too. The worst part was, they don't say ""Gee, we're really sorry about this. Can we offer you some free extra biscuits' - or something along those lines.
Given these people are underpaid and probably not treated with much respect, however, I am the damn customer. At least schmoose me enough to make sure I walk away with some kind of positive experience.  The food was fine, but that is standard since all of these places work on a system.  
Two points.  This place of business is not run like a place of business.  Also, if you don't like your $12.00 an hour no benefits job, get out there and convince someone you are worth decent pay and benefits.  If you choose to work for minimum, you still have to perform professionally.",Blair C.,"San Francisco,CA",1
"One basically me and my father wanted to order a 8 pec with 2 side but the lady Elizabeth over there said ""we"" can have ""only one side and Elizabeth is a rude person",Just l.,"Union City, NJ",1
"Terrible. Horrible decisions.

My mind tells me no as I walked up the hill to this delicious franchise, but my body marches on. Once I get to the emotional state that I need a two piece and thigh, nothing can stop me.

AMBIANCE slowly reminds me of my decision. Squeezing into this tiny spot with the large number of people inside sobers me up. But we've come this far.

ORDERED as my go to items: 2 waffles and 3 piece dark with 2 biscuits.

I've waited anywhere from 15 minutes to 1 hour for my food. Regret sinks in.

FOOD is delicious going down the hatch, although I realize the error of my ways.

OVERALL a timid two stars. Quicker service and prepared food is needed.",Nicholas G.,"San Francisco, CA",2
"Look y'all. My standards really aren't that high. I'm ordering from a KFC/Taco Bell after 9pm on a Sunday. But this was easily the most terrifyingly disgusting fast food place I've ever seen.
Starting very specifically with the workers. The person taking my order continued to blow her nose all over the counter, my screen and myself, the line cooks were screaming the most ridiculous profane things the entire time at both the patrons and the staff. Everything took forever. Multiple people who had already paid for their meals just eventually gave up over waiting in this insane environment. Literally every inch of this place was covered in trash and filth.
Every single person working here, and in charge of here, deserves to be fired immediately. I have NEVER been so appalled by a place. Holy heck. Place needs to be shut down RIGHT NOW.
If any of staff is reading this, I will be contacting corporate, demanding a refund, and honestly probably suing for death by food poisoning. Jesus Christ."," 
Sarah S.","Los Angeles, CA",1
"First, they got my order wrong which I let slide. But the chicken at this location was gross, the skin was all soft and mushy not crispy at all and the thigh was dry. The fries were ok don't know what the ""secret recipe"" is but barely any flavor couldn't even tell.",Alison W.,"San Francisco, CA",2

"I've been here two or three times in the last three years. I was passing by and was very hungry, only reason why I ate there. It's a typical KFC with Taco Bell. It's located in a great area, with no crazy homeless people camping, begging around, or getting inside the KFC to protect themselves from the cold, which is already a big plus for any establishment in San Francisco.

I had a three-piece combo for $10.00. I chose the Mountain Dew Blast soda from their soda machine, which delivered a great soda with a full flavor.  The customer crowd was decent and the customer service was fine. The sitting area was dirty, as was the entire floor. The space here is very limited."," 
Raymond F.
","San Francisco, CA",4
"This location is subpar. It's just your typical KFC but the employees are the ones that made an impression on my visit. Essentially we stopped by just for a quick snack because traffic was horrible. When we went inside to order, the cashier was pretty short tempered. She just had a ""leave me alone"" attitude. This put a damper on our visit. But it only got worse. This location was filthy which I didn't understand because there weren't that many customers in the store. The only reason we stayed was because we knew rush hour was pretty bad at the time of our visit."," 
Jermaine C.
","Torrance, CA",1
"It's all about management. We used to come here whenever I really didn't want to cook. The manager's name was Doug. The store was always clean, food good, rarely out of anything. Since he left the store had plummeted in quality. They are constantly out if something, every time we go, the store is always dirty and the food is rarely done right. We've stopped coming much at all, today is the last day.","Trey L.
","San Francisco, CA",1
"I was at KFC today and got 3 Piece Strips $5 Fill-up Meal and I was disappointed due to my strips were overcooked, dry and hard to chew and swallow, the best thing that take came out of it was my chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies that came with my meal and my medium strawberry soda. Since I do enjoy their Mashed Potatoes and Gravy and their Coleslaw I was disappointed in myself because I forgot to get a spoon.

Since they did changed managers I do miss the last manager ""Douglass"" maybe he was moved to a another location or he retired. He always very friendly and polite and funny I got feeling I was in Kentucky from the country music playing. Now this KFC has changed in a way that No music is playing anymore and the new manager is a 20 something also somewhat friendly.

But it's KFC you know!!",Panaligan-Jung A.,"San Francisco, CA",2
"another sucky visit to KFC.

"This KFC/Taco Bell has had its waves of good and bad over the years, but I have to say it's in the middle of a bad wave again :-( I went in last night - Saturday night - It was a little busy... I was told they stop serving chicken at 8pm now. What?! That's right, no chicken after 8pm. So I got a few tacos. Place was filthy and there were only three people on staff. One to take orders (with a little bit of an attitude) one to make all the orders (seemed super tired and overworked) and another person I guess to support the food prep. Wild Cherry Pepsi was just spitting out water, and everyone was so busy it took awhile to get that Pepsi happening again. Any request I had was met with incredulity. Why is it so hard to get this KFC up to a decent standard? I don't know, but I don't want to go back.","

"This KFC is a hit and miss. Again it's literally opposite my pad so I have come here a few times. Hopefully if you ever come here, Dwayne is your cashier. He'll always give you a free thing or two or....three. And with Dwayne there, you are probably going to get a better meal. I've noticed when he isn't that the food pretty much sucks and is deserving of a 1 star.When he is, the food is actually bearable. Surprising for one of the greasiest fast foods in America.",Ray H.,"

"I don't write reviews.  I'm not sure anyone reads them.  However I'm sending this to the owner of the KFC/Taco Bell on Duboce in SF.  A few years ago, I met you and told you how you had a great team. They were respectful, trained well, efficient, etc.  I moved away and have now returned and over the last month, I've visited your store on a couple of occasions.  You seem to be a man of great pride.  Here is my advice; fire EVERYONE IN THE STORE AND START OVER.  Your team is always playing with each other.  They get visitors (friends) all the time.  They are slow.  They don't care about customers.  Today, a 4 year old asked for a cup of water and they said they had no cups.  It's a 4 year old!   What would it have taken to give her a cup of water???!!!!!!   A customer's rider was wrong and instead of fixing it, they told him to get in line again.  You need to step in and get rid of these people.  If you are the same owner, I know you care.  If you are a new owner, you need to care.  I own a couple of businesses and if my team behaved like this they would be gone.","Antonio B.

KFC is a best or most super fast food outlet.Its deserve to visit at this place for eating fast food at town.
It's crispy chicken broast is very authentic food.Specially with French fries.And best
sauce .Its a worth visiting place .
It's a nice place to visit at night after evening for dine.

"NEVER eat at this location. The MANAGER just passed me a soda that was dripping down the cup. I explained that he needs to clean that off. He proceeds to WIPE HIS BARE HANDS DOWN MY CUP!!!!When I told him to make me another he asked if I was serious? Then gets mad, announces to the line that he had to go wash his hands. He comes back to the register with an attitude, rings me up and tells me someone will call me name for food. I was floored. As I explained above this is the manager. He had on all black with a gold name tag. This is beyond customer service. This is a food safety concern at this point.

"Delivery fail. We ordered in excess of $47 in food via DoorDash and only HALF of the food arrived!
AND No answer when we called the KFC store.
This is extremely frustrating considering we spent almost half a hundy and we are trying to support local businesses in this stressful time.
They may try to blame DoorDash but the bag was stapled shut so I don't think the driver snagged a Scooby snack for himself.

KFC has changed the quality of chicken they use and it's awful now. The pieces are super tiny with virtually no meat on them...vastly different from what their chicken used to be like. I literally ate 4 pieces of chicken and I was still hungry. Guess they're trying to save money but they've lost me as a customer.,"Michelle C.
","San Francisco, CA",1
"DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE. Give your business to restaurants that actually provide good food and good service. This KFC does neither. Every time I order delivery from here, I receive the wrong thing.  If I order thighs and legs, I always receive mostly breasts. EVERY TIME. It's almost as if they're doing it on purpose. Not only that - most of the chicken is undercooked - it's all going in the trash. Disgusting. Nobody working here seems to give a shit. And nobody from KFC ever responds to my reviews - proof that even management doesn't give a shit. I am DONE. And delivery adds so much to the order since Grub Hub adds about 40% in fees to what should be a relatively inexpensive order. By the time you add a tip you might as well get food from a more upscale restaurant.
KFC - work on your customer service - you're the next to go out of business.","Michelle C.
","San Francisco, CA",1
"Chicken is good but both times I ordered delivery from this location the order was incorrect.  First time, I ordered a 12 piece bucket and received an 8 piece bucket. Second time, I ordered legs and thighs and received a mix.  The employees at this location clearly don't give a shit.  Won't order from here again.

Corporate - if you read these reviews, you might want to consider closing this location.  Or hire employees who actually give a shit. There are a lot of people who are out of work who would actually care if they did a good job.","Michelle C.

I've been all over SF and safety is generally not a corner but this place is shady as fuck.

"The service was friendly and fast, and the food was hot and delicious. I'm not going to rate this place lower just because there was a homeless man inside. He didn't bother anyone, and didn't detract at all from my experience. I'd personally be far more bothered by a snotty woman wishing for gentrification all because she just can't understand why a fast food establishment would let homeless people inside.

Maybe if people stopped worrying about what everyone else is doing, they'd be able to enjoy what's in front of them, like the delicious KFC this place serves.

"We all know how this story goes right? yelp.com/biz/taco-bell-s…

But I digress, KFC is not Taco Bell and Taco Bell isn't KFC. They may share the same roof and counter, hell, even the same workers, but hardly one in the same. Do I really feel like the late colonel's basket over the same snoozefest of Taco Bell? Tenderloin standards, that's a yes.

To eat KFC here happily is one thing, but to settle for it is the more likely scenario. When all the shops of the wonderful Little Saigon are closed, guess who's open? KFC. You can't stomach the wait at Brenda's (yelp.com/biz/brendas-fre…), who's just around the corner? KFC. When you feel like getting your fingers disgustingly greasy and touching the same surfaces that have graced many a hobo in the most unflattering scenarios imaginable, who's up for it? That's right baby, KFC.

There is no glory in eating here. Merely stories meant to be told for later. I could share many wonderful accounts that range from craziness to straight up absurd, but that's to be written for another date.

In the meantime, I can reveal that I had my first and only Double Down Sandwich (yelp.com/biz_photos/kfc-…) here and clearly, I lived to tell the tale.

Ok, one weird story: I witnessed a guy tweaking out and managed to order himself a family sized bucket of chicken. After tossing a wad of crumpled up dollar bills on the counter he looked like he was doing the robot dance, except he was hopping up and down. When his chicken was ready and on the counter, he took the entire bucket with him and went into the restroom and locked the door. My group and I waited for close to 30 minutes, hoping for something epic. He never came out.

"It was an awful experience! The so called manager was so incompetent he almost gave someone else my order. Then I checked my order and found my biscuit missing! He never apologized and bragged about being professional. I waited 25 minutes for 2 boxes of 2 pieces of chicken..He shoved both orders in one box with one biscuit.The place was half filled with people not ordering or eating , just sitting there with their dogs.I worked in food service for 46 years. This was awful!This place now sucks!!!No more from THIS store!

"Where's the nearest one from work?
Yes, here and parking isn't that difficult either.
A friend's fried chicken craving drew me here.  
After buying something at the Walgreen's up the block, I walked here and ordered my usual suspects for myself.
Crispy taco supreme (yelp.com/user_local_phot…).  Check.
Cole slaw.  Check.
Apple turnovers (yelp.com/user_local_phot…).  Check again.
Coming on a Monday, was able to score on their daily special too (yelp.com/user_local_phot…).  
Please bear in the mind the neighborhood is sketchy, being in the Tenderloin.  Wouldn't stop by here after dark unless necessary.   Brenda's is just a few doors down so this can be a pre-meal snack for those growling stomachs.  If you work downtown or near Civic Center/City Hall, this is the closest one.

"Every time I see a Taco Bell/KFC the same joke pops in my head.

[ghetto voice]  ""I WORK 2 JOBS!"" [/ghetto voice]

That, coupled with the fact that there is never a dull moment in this location, warrants a review.

I work in this neighborHOOD so, if you know the area well enough, options are in your favor. Everything from banh mi, food trucks, pho, power exchange...you name it, its here. And on those days you don't feel like making an executive decision and your palate is feeling feisty, some greasy ass KFC will fit the bill.

I wont review KFC or Taco Bell... this review is strictly about the experience that this location offers.

10/28/14 - 12:31pm: it's a Tuesday. You know song ""club going up on a Tuesday?"". Well, CB must have missed the fact that KFC offers a 2 piece for $1.99 on Tuesday. You have every walk of life in here; suits, techies, homeless, more homeless, dogs?, and just some questionable characters.

I walked in with a life half way out the door, every one in dire need of some chicken. To my left, a toothless woman dancing to Cher. To my right, a hefty lady in sweatpants and a tank top yelling at a worker for more hot sauce and behind me a guy wearing google glasses (see: glasshole).... You cant make this stuff up.
I challenge you to order and eat in house, the circus continues. Within a 10 minute span, I was asked for change twice, some guy blaring yung joc on his phone, and I think some old Chinese lady farted in front of me.

Now, is a sanitary restaurant is one of your non-negotiables, keep walking down to Brenda's. If you want lunch and a show without spending those silly asiaSF prices... come here. In fact, I think I've seen some asiaSF ""ladies"" in line waiting on tacos.

God I love you, SF.","

"My friend and I were craving KFC after a walk/jog so we headed by the one closest to home.  This one is not in the best area and the clientele are a bit interesting.  I saw the comments of the other reviewers, but I thought the cashier was really trying to provide good customer service and helped us pick the right meal combo to suit our needs.  They did run out of regular Pepsi and were low on coin change, but they gave us lots of hot sauce, butter, honey and ketchup and lots of patience so I could not complain.  I would come back, especially since this one is the closest to me.

I brought my $20 fill up meal for my bf and I including both white and dark meat original, mash potatoes and gravy, coleslaw and corn on the cob, and it was all so yummy!  It covered us for lunch and diner the following day.  We were happy!","

They made me wait an entire hour and the order hasn't even been picked up! If I knew it was going to take this long, I would've ordered else where! Why am I paying this service fee for? Ya'll not doing your damn job making sure these orders get to your hungry customers. 0 STARS

Where's the nearest one from work?
Yes, here and parking isn't that difficult either.
A friend's fried chicken craving drew me here.  
After buying something at the Walgreen's up the block, I walked here and ordered my usual suspects for myself.
Crispy taco supreme (yelp.com/user_local_phot…).  Check.
Cole slaw.  Check.
Apple turnovers (yelp.com/user_local_phot…).  Check again.
Coming on a Monday, was able to score on their daily special too (yelp.com/user_local_phot…).  
Please bear in the mind the neighborhood is sketchy, being in the Tenderloin.  Wouldn't stop by here after dark unless necessary.   Brenda's is just a few doors down so this can be a pre-meal snack for those growling stomachs.  If you work downtown or near Civic Center/City Hall, this is the closest one.  I usually stop at the Geary and 6th Ave. one, but, on this day, this location made sense.

For the past week and a half there has been NO hot wings!! Unbelievable. And the excuse given is the ""manager is the one who orders that"".......how about I call the Colonel Sanders personally and report this atrocity!!

Pissed and hungry!!

Every time I see a Taco Bell/KFC the same joke pops in my head.

[ghetto voice]  ""I WORK 2 JOBS!"" [/ghetto voice]

That, coupled with the fact that there is never a dull moment in this location, warrants a review.

I work in this neighborHOOD so, if you know the area well enough, options are in your favor. Everything from banh mi, food trucks, pho, power exchange...you name it, its here. And on those days you don't feel like making an executive decision and your palate is feeling feisty, some greasy ass KFC will fit the bill.

I wont review KFC or Taco Bell... this review is strictly about the experience that this location offers.

10/28/14 - 12:31pm: it's a Tuesday. You know song ""club going up on a Tuesday?"". Well, CB must have missed the fact that KFC offers a 2 piece for $1.99 on Tuesday. You have every walk of life in here; suits, techies, homeless, more homeless, dogs?, and just some questionable characters.

I walked in with a life half way out the door, every one in dire need of some chicken. To my left, a toothless woman dancing to Cher. To my right, a hefty lady in sweatpants and a tank top yelling at a worker for more hot sauce and behind me a guy wearing google glasses (see: glasshole).... You cant make this stuff up.
I challenge you to order and eat in house, the circus continues. Within a 10 minute span, I was asked for change twice, some guy blaring yung joc on his phone, and I think some old Chinese lady farted in front of me.

Now, is a sanitary restaurant is one of your non-negotiables, keep walking down to Brenda's. If you want lunch and a show without spending those silly asiaSF prices... come here. In fact, I think I've seen some asiaSF ""ladies"" in line waiting on tacos.

God I love you, SF.

Insulting.

My friend and I were craving KFC after a walk/jog so we headed by the one closest to home.  This one is not in the best area and the clientele are a bit interesting.  I saw the comments of the other reviewers, but I thought the cashier was really trying to provide good customer service and helped us pick the right meal combo to suit our needs.  They did run out of regular Pepsi and were low on coin change, but they gave us lots of hot sauce, butter, honey and ketchup and lots of patience so I could not complain.  I would come back, especially since this one is the closest to me.

I brought my $20 fill up meal for my bf and I including both white and dark meat original, mash potatoes and gravy, coleslaw and corn on the cob, and it was all so yummy!  It covered us for lunch and diner the following day.  We were happy!

I Double Downed at KFC last night and am oddly unapologetic about it. [yelp.com/biz_photos/ZJch… Yes that's two fried chicken filets encasing two pieces of bacon, two melted slices of Monterey Jack and pepper jack cheese and the Colonel's Sauce. Curiosity (and 7 beers) killed the cat and I'm kinda glad it did.

Rationally, it's a heart attack waiting to happen but the mind doesn't work that way late at night. It's offensive to look at but you viscerally want to put in your mouth anyway. It was a quick grab and go meal - I was on my way in under 5 minutes. The Double Down is surprisingly easy to eat on the run but keep lots of napkins handy.

This KFC, by virtue of its location, has a mixed bag of folks in it. But like I said earlier, you're in and out in no time. So don't over-intellectualize the Double Down sandwich- how obscene it is, how many calories (540 according to KFC), or what have you... just try it to say you did it. You might oddly enjoy it as much as I did.","

"This is a interesting KFC.  The suburban KFC's are pretty boring. This one located in the Tenderloin has a diverse clientele. Regular people, homeless people, hookers, and trannies. I have been coming to this place on and off for several years. I have seen a lot of weird stuff happening at this KFC.

Since this place also has a Taco Bell Franchise, the food selection is very good. The customer service is also very good. Some of the staff already memorized my first name even though I do not come to this place that often.

The regular menu items are  good. There are some hits and misses though. The pacific shrimp taco was bland and overpriced. However, the KFC Double Down is pretty good. It is also low in carbs. This item is basically KFC's version of the Chicken Cordon Bleu. It is Haute French cuisine KFC style, with KFC prices. Moreover, it is also KFC's answer to Carl's Jr. Low Carb Six Dollar Burger.","Hiroshi K.

"hursday is chicken pot pie day ($2.99) at KFC.  Instead of getting the pie, I had a BOGO coupon for 2 pc. boneless chicken, with one side, one b-b-b-biscuit (LOL) and a medium drink for $4.99.  Coupon had an expiration date of 5/12/2013.  

I ordered one of these meals for myself and received a free one for somebody, anybody who wouldn't mind having a free lunch, even though it was not an extravagant meal coming from an expensive restaurant.  It's not Chicken Soup to feed the soul, but a chicken meal to feed it.

Today was a good day for me.  A homeless woman came in, wanted one piece of chicken, but did not have enough money in her paper cup to pay for it.  She went back outside and sat on the sidewalk to see if anybody would drop some loose change in her cup.  Voila, this is the woman who was the recipient of a free lunch.  She thanked me and told me to have a nice rest of the day.

While I was walking by Brenda's Soul Food to head back to work, the late JB was in the house...song of the day - ""Shake Yo Money Maker"" - hey, hey - ya know me - I had to shake my rump to that funk and I didn't care people were lookin' cuz I know how to have a ""funky good time"".  Naw, I did not ""bend over and shake that tail feather"" all the way down Polk to Turk...LOL.

How was the boneless chicken?  Hey, it wasn't that bad...actually the employees at this KFC hooked this sistah up with two humongous pieces of boneless chicken and I enjoyed it with my honey (packets, not the honeydew(do) I have at home).

Yep, today was a good day in San Fran at KFC, my knowing that a total stranger got a free lunch and was grateful to receive a chicken meal to feed her soul from a stranger - me.","Carol C.

"This is the closest KFC to my office.  It's not often that I have KFC for lunch, but I had a coupon for a chicken pot pie for a price of $3.49.  Lo and behold, I got to KFC and I lucked out.  I did not have to use the coupon after all because the special for Thursday was chicken pot pie for $2.99...yay.    

A few weeks ago, it was a BOGO coupon for the chicken bites, a side and a drink for $3.99.  I took advantage of this special and provided my friend, Christina (homeless woman) at the Civic Center BART with a meal to tide her over for the morning.  The bites were meh, they didn't look like what was advertised and they were somewhat scrawny looking - 2.0  However, I did enjoy the cole slaw and raspberry tea that came along with the meal.  Christina was grateful for her dinner, which I included a soft bagel roll w/butter and 2 pieces of chocolate candy for dessert.

KFC's chicken pot pie is something that I haven't had for over 10 years.  I didn't know they still prepare those pies.  This time around, the pie was smaller.  Yep, they downsized it, but for a little over $5.00 (medium raspberry tea included) for lunch I am not complaining.  The pie was piping hot and just a tad too salty, but still edible.  The proportion of pieces of spicy chicken, carrots, potatoes and peas were just right.  The crust was baked to a perfect golden brown all around.  Chicken pot pie, cole slaw and raspberry tea are the only things I order from KFC; forget all the other items.    

Finally, of all the people standing in line and/or waiting for their order, hardly any of them ordered chicken pot pie and I figured out why.  It takes the employees a while to fill that order.  I was waiting longer than some of the people who ordered their items after me.  Again, I am not complaining.  I figure what's worth waiting is worth getting, and such is the case with the chicken pot pie...lol.","Carol C.

"Service was good last time I went. I came in with a coupon and the cashier gave me an even better deal than the one on the coupon.

It's not KFC's fault, but there was a homeless man in line in front of me who smelled like piss and could barely stand up. If dogs aren't allowed in food establishments for health reasons, this man certainly shouldn't have been allowed. Spending $5 on fried chicken and soda when you're literally living in the streets and there's free food for the homeless throughout SF? Reinforces the idea that there's no such thing as poor people, just poor money choices.

Luckily, he was the exception, and the slow line contained a decent proportion of normal people to drugged out/crazy homeless people. Almost 1:1! Thank goodness. Gentrification can't come fast enough to this location.","

"You're not reading this review to learn about the food. Good, because I'm not writing it about the food.

This location needs security. Bouncers. To keep people out who can't read and/or can't pay. And people who are obviously on drugs. Or hallucinating. Or who have recently urinated on themselves or slept or sat in urine. Because none of that is very palatable for the decent, paying customer, now is it?","

"This has to be the worst KFC in the entire city and by far the worst chicken I've ever eaten. I've been to several other KFCs in the city but decided to give this one a try since it's now closest to my apt. Big mistake!

First, they forgot to give us a small wedges we ordered but we didn't want to go back. We got 20 hot wings, which were extremely dry and the batter was disgusting like it had been reheated or refried 10x. We also got the 4pc grilled chicken which was also dry and tasteless. Their corn also isn't on a stick like other KFCs, just wrapped in foil.

Can't forget to mention the drug dealing that goes on in their 2 car parking space area. If you're craving KFC, DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT GO TO THIS ONE! Go a little further to another one and thank me later.","

"This place is a bit tired, even for the KFC Taco Bell brand.  The posters in there are like vintage 1990's throwbacks with a bit of age-old residue from the fryers.  I was surprised to learn that the Gordita meal, #6, has insanely increased about 200% in purchase price.  I thought these were $6.50-7.80, now they are running about $11.80.  Seems really strange, unless this is a boutique location.  I'm not even talking about the plus sized drink y'all.  I got the chicken, noting that is an upgrade.  The chicken was a bit dry and seemed older than a day truly.  The overall was ok, but a bit disappointing as I still needed to run across the street to Subway to complete my appetite.  

What sort of kills the experience is the venue, location, and experience.  The workers seemed a bit slow and made me not exactly trust the product that was coming my way.  I'll give them a pass on the whole ""plagued by street people"" portion as this goes without saying for anything near this location - KFC cannot be held responsible for that.  A lot of these businesses need to reach out to the city for a bit more of a hand with controlling the substance abuse problems and vagrancies that plague their businesses, but I'm sure that's been harped on for years with little response.  

You would just think that KFC, TacoBell, Subway would have some lobbying power with the high-profile campaign donation interest system that Ed Lee currently runs in San Francisco, but I guess they didn't make the right contributions to get the cronies to strong arm and protect this location.  Dang, you would think that running a business would be a good thing for the city.  But if you don't have Twitter money there are no protections.","

"This location has improved over the last 5 years.  Wendy, who is always there to take your order, is very professional, friendly, and helpful.  The ordering process is quick and fulfillment follows within minutes.  The food is just as tasty as other KFC/TB locations.  The retail seating space requires constant cleaning due to the uneducated folks who dine and believe in not cleaning after themselves.  The lighting could be better.

Does the location still have homeless and bums occasionally?  Of course - it reflects the neighborhood. Wendy and her team does an excellent job of keeping the location running given the challenges of their surroundings.","Antonio E.

"Portal to the netherworld? TL x KFC = HELL

On my way to the gym I was totally starved and didn't want to work out on an empty stomach so I thought I'd swing by kfc and get a drumstick for some cheap protein.

WRONG choice. I immediately step into some ghoulish other world where the patrons look like they're near death or recently departed. The guy in front of me in line looked like Keith Richards in a hundred years and was accompanied by a woman (??) , wearing a big ratty blonde wig and some moth eaten pink dress, who stood there stiffly like a propped up skeleton. There was a kid seated at a table with his hoodie zipped up all the way, backwards, with the hood covering his face, while he dragged his hooded head back and forth over the table.

The location itself makes it hard to be in because the area attracts a bad crowd, currently there is human shit on the outside wall and the sidewalk of this location. There is always ghetto loud people in here that look and act like they're on drugs, and they smell horrible. Most of the employees look like they're on drugs as well, crack I was assume. They don't treat customers well, they get the orders wrong all the time and they give you attitude, they always seem annoyed when I'm at the register just giving them a simple order. Most people hate their jobs, I get it but you don't have to give me attitude for it. They're slacking off here a lot too, they're on their phones a lot, always getting simple orders wrong.

"Let's say you meet someone and you develop an instant addiction to them.  At first, things are great and you spend all your time in their company.  And even though he hits you, it feels like a kiss; and even though you sense the codependency, you still persevere.  But soon things degenerate and you wonder why you've been together for so long -- you realize you're slowly dying inside, fucking asshole never loved you anyway, so you pull a Bikini Kill by screaming ""IT'S HARD TO TALK WITH YOUR DICK IN MY MOUTH, FUCK YOU NAT SHERMAN"" and kick his ass to the curb.

I'm speaking, of course, of the smoking habit that I've recently given up.  I haven't had a cigarette since Sunday at 1.16 pm.

That's right. I'm weak; I'm a QUITTER. I'm such a huge MOTHERFUCKING FAILURE that I can't even SUCCEED AT ADDICTION!!!

These days emphysema no longer has that ""outsider appeal"" it used to have, and I no longer think of stomas and vocoders as fashionable accessories to pair with my Lanvin sneakers.

Have you ever met anyone as uncool and pathetic as me?!?  

Oh and I won't sport ten Nicorette patches while chewing nicotine gum or anything. Fuck no. I'm a man's man who fucks men -- I'm doing this COLD TURKEY. This of course means that my withdrawal symptoms are INTENSE; it also means that I will be a stone-cold RAVING BITCH for a while, and I DEMAND that all of you who put the gun to my head in the name of clean living spend a lot of time in my company!  

Yeah, that's right -- PEER PRESSURE.  HOW DARE YOU EXPRESS CONCERN FOR MY HEALTH. FUCK! I hate EVERYONE! And by ""everyone,"" I mean you. And you. And you too. And especially you. (KIDDING)

ANYWAY, after MURDERING 1,234 people last night with my bare hands in an ORGY OF VIOLENCE caused by nicotine withdrawal, I had tremors and a throbbing headache akin to Fran fucking Drescher screeching arias into my ear.  I needed some cheap, stomach-turning comfort food.  

So I walked to this surprisingly CLEAN KFC with friendly employees, dodging the hookers and other sketch in the TL (all of whom were SMOKING, of course).  

Now I know you will say ""Darin, KFC is DISGUSTING, I can't believe you CHOSE to eat here!""  And in turn *I* will say ""Shut the fuck up, like you never ate the Colonel before!""  And, ""why don't you say that to my face BITCH!  I'll slap you silly and put my CIGARETTE out on your -- wait. Oh. Fuck. Me.""

I picked up a T6 meal (two baja chalupas, a hard shell taco), two original recipe breasts, a serving of mac and cheese, and an empanada.  

Perhaps it was the delicious faux Mex taste of the chalupas, or the juicy chicken breasts secreting enough oil to fill a Wesson bottle, or the unnaturally orange mac and cheese, or the sugar rush brought on by the corn syrup in the empanada, but I felt one hundred times better.  Suddenly, my throbbing headache was gone!

Well, it was either the food or the spork I violently shoved into my skull.

"By far the WORST KFC ever.

Employees eating behind the counter - not good, and I think not something allowed by the health department (at least ages ago when I worked in food service).

Lots of people behind the counter, none of whom are actually working, but certainly having lots of personal conversations and cellphone calls.

Food not being prepared -- they ran out of cooked chicken at 6PM and were JUST STARTING a new batch -- they're supposed to be continuously cooking versus waiting to run out completely.

Bad attitudes all around.

They pay attention to their friends across the counter though - especially if a friend is making a ""delivery""...

Saw at least 3 street-people stumble in to use the bathroom (which had a big ""CLOSED"" sign on it...) -- in and out in a couple of minutes and the lovely smell of crack-pipe...

"This is a review for the KFC part of the KFC/Taco Bell location.  

This place was poppin' from the deluge of people celebrating PRIDE 2008.  I was feeling faint from not eating so mats when I was prepping for and executing my performance for the Pearls of the Orient Dragmania Hour at the API Pavillion/Stage.  My beloved Kroo were cool enough to accompany me so I can satisfy my craving for the Colonel's Original Recipe chicken.... so we went here to get some snackypoos before we headed to Oakland for our real ribs meal.  

The KFC/Taco Bell crew were well prepared for the deluge of people.... they had a very efficient cashier/ordering system... and the sous chefs at the back were on point as well.  

I was very satisfied with my Original Recipe, Chicken Only (2 pieces leg/thigh with biscuit) order.

"KFC is what all chickens aspire to. The news says there are steroids in the chicken, but that is because the chickens work hard to make the cut and naturally, some cheat.

My boyfriend will drive me here for meals, usually to cheer me up or just as a special surprise. I have to say, the food is tasty and KFC-quality. Which means it's quality.

The only gripes I have may be just associated with the time of the night we go there. It's usually very late and cleaning gets lax. Tables don't get completely cleared off and it's harder to find a clean table. They also run out of items toward the end of the night.

"This place gets 2 stars just for being so damn entertaining.

Ok useful information first--it's open until 1am on the weekends. It's actually a Taco Bell/ KFC combo inside. The 19 bus line stops in front. There is someone outside panhandling 90% of the time. Allright now you know that. Now you ask why is this KFC so entertaining?

I live in close proximity to this location. If you've ever wondered what it'd be like to live near one let me indulge you. I'm not close enough to get any roaches or rats in my place so don't worry. My place is pretty much creepy crawly free.

First off, my apartment smells like KFC at random points throughout the day. This has a strange effect on people, particularly on men. It's like their senses are heightened.

KFC is what all chickens aspire to. The news says there are steroids in the chicken, but that is because the chickens work hard to make the cut and naturally, some cheat.

My boyfriend will drive me here for meals, usually to cheer me up or just as a special surprise. I have to say, the food is tasty and KFC-quality. Which means it's quality.

The only gripes I have may be just associated with the time of the night we go there. It's usually very late and cleaning gets lax. Tables don't get completely cleared off and it's harder to find a clean table. They also run out of items toward the end of the night. It's disappointing to go and find out they don't have what you want.

This place gets 2 stars just for being so damn entertaining.

Ok useful information first--it's open until 1am on the weekends. It's actually a Taco Bell/ KFC combo inside. The 19 bus line stops in front. There is someone outside panhandling 90% of the time. Allright now you know that. Now you ask why is this KFC so entertaining?

I live in close proximity to this location. If you've ever wondered what it'd be like to live near one let me indulge you. I'm not close enough to get any roaches or rats in my place so don't worry. My place is pretty much creepy crawly free.

First off, my apartment smells like KFC at random points throughout the day. This has a strange effect on people, particularly on men. It's like their senses are heightened. The weak crumble and ask me for my keys only to return with bags 10 ten minutes later. I'm also prone to a little recreational smoking and well, you want to open the window...yeah...love that Polk Street windtunnel! Blow that chicken smell into my stoner nostrils! While this has driven me half insane with munchies (and being that I live in a supermodel apartment--i.e. no food--this is torture), I have eaten there less than 5 times in the last 2 1/2 years.

I know it's bad for me. I know that when I buy it, I look like a walking stereotype... but damn it... I sometimes can't fight the craving for fried chicken!

I've been to this location of KFC a few times and have always been surprised at the speed of service. I just wish that I didn't have to walk through the Tenderloin to get there.


Good food selection. Staff is usually friendly and tries to get the line through quickly. Good prices.

The store needs to clean off tables and the floors more frequently. I feel bad they have to deal with the bums and dirty people that come in -- but if the place was cleaner, maybe this type of person won't leave a mess too. Or they would just stay on the streets, go someplace else. C'mon lazy people -- pick up after yourself and put your trash in the garbage cans everyone.","John G.

I went in 30 minutes before closing that the manager Christina provided excellent customer service. I asked for a 20 piece and she had some more chicken made for me so i could get what i wanted. I have been in there other occasions when Christina wasn't there and i wasn't able to get what i needed. Normally when i go to most places the employee's are in a rush to get off work and don't want to make any more food and you end up either getting nothing or having to get something that you didn't want. Not this time.,"

Most KFC's deserve 3 stars but this location deserves 4 stars.  Here's a couple of reasons:
1) Parking lot - Yes, I know it only fits two cars but how many other fast food restaurants around the Tenderloin have their own parking lot?  My only gripe is for these people to park b/w the designated lines.
2) Cashier's are funny - I forgot the names but the owner/proprieter and the white guy are talkative and make sure you have everything you need and even tips to dress up as Colonel Sanders for Halloween.  Considering the type of clientele that are in the neighborhood, I commend these guys for keeping their sanity and having fun.
3) Dining room is quite spacious given the location","Benny M.

"KFC is what you expect and you either love it or not.  However this location on Eddy is better than the rest.  The food for some reason tastes better, which could be due in part to the excellent staff.  The manager Francis always has his staff working hard, and they genuinely smile and laugh with the customers.  Christana always remembers my name, how amazing is that at a fast food place, an remembers my order.  I live by the Lombard location, however travel to this location just because of the staff.

"On a typical day at this KFC if you order a bucket you may open it to find a homeless man laying in the bottom surrounded by bones,  but on tuesday nights its the two piece for 99 cent deal so they serve the goods up too fast for them to crawl into your food.  Add a side and drink for another dollar.  I dont care how many hobos you have to fight off to get in the door, this deal is effing epic to this fat boy.","

I went in this place the other night with my friend. She was sick and wanted to go here, since she lives on the same block. We get in and wait a few minutes and then get up to the counter to order, and this extremely nasty bum walks in. We were a good 10 feet away and could smell him. I was gagging. The manager yells at him and asks if he's going to buy anything. So then he proceeds to walk up to the counter (!!!) and drops the nastiest 5 dollar bill I've ever seen on the counter and asks how much chicken he can get with the 5 dollar bill. The manager tells him and tells him to go back outside and he'll bring it to him. Then proceeds to get a can of febreeze and follow him out the door. It was gross as all hell, but the manager deserves credit for getting the guy out of the store before everyone yacked. The chicken was decent, btw.","

"I love KFC, I just hate this one on Eddy and Polk.  I called in a new batch of hot wings and when I got there, they refused to sell  them to me.  They lied and said they were all fried at the same time but if you look at it, there is a clear divide in the new and the old.  Old ones accessible from the front, new ones placed in from the back.  Didn't feel like arguing with them and was on my way.  I asked for hot sauce, she said they ran out.  I asked for jalapeno and she said they don't sell them.  Arrrgg!

"this kfc is pretty busy as it's in the tenderloin and in close proximity to the courts and city hall.  there is at least 1 panhandler outside, but they mean no harm.

the staff is friend and attentive, and most of them like chatting with their customers.  there's a restroom in the back that is very, very dirty.  it's basically like a public outdoor restroom as people walk in an out of there regularly.  the place is kept clean though and although there might be some tables occupied by a sleeping panhandler, there are plenty of tables to sit at.  

the drink fountain is in a weird spot as it's near the counter where you pick up the food, however, it's in a small corner and if you're filling up your cup, you're likely blocking someone trying to get out.

they have a tuesday $2.99 special, which is 2 pieces of chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy, cole slaw and a buscuit and a wednesday $2.99 special - chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes",Ray R.,"

"I don't know which was more fun: the walk to KFC from my apartment, or the walk back to my apartment from KFC. I asked my friend meghan where to get fried chicken in the tenderloin, and she told me to go to Farmer Brown. (And I was excited to try Farmer Brown). Then I asked her where the nearest KFC was, you know, ""just so I'll know."" She told me and as we hung up the phone, I think we both knew where I was going. I was barely able to contain my glee walking down O'Farrell... Do I have any change? Yes, I do, but I'm gonna spend it all on fried chicken, or whatever it is they fry at Kentucky Fried Chicken--frankly I could give two shits. I stood in line, waited my turn, and placed my order. I spent $8.29 at KFC, ordering no drink, no sides, just chicken *substitute correct chicken substitute term here and throughout the rest of my review whenever you see the word chicken, if that's the kind of thing you worry about, which means you probably are not reading online reviews of Kentucky Fried Chicken.* Chicken was ready, lickety-split, grab that shit, high-tail it back to the apt, kick off the shoes, into bed with a box of delicious fried chicken. The popcorn chicken managed to stay warm all the way home, and that big breast--it was so tender inside I practically clicked my heels that I had gone with my heart and skipped Farmer Brown.

wooooooow... WOOOOOWW.. I saw their ad on Instagram FREE delivery they say. I guess this is why I don't use grub hub. Something always happens to my order. Placed  huge order for dinner tonight, was planning on Quarantine and Chill, binge through Joe Exotic's Tiger King.

Didn't happened. KFC mobile app sucks.. downloaded and uninstalled right away. Used their website and placed my order right? 40 minutes into the first episode of Tiger King and I get a notification that my food has arrived. How? If my door buzzer hasn't rung.

Right away I called Grubhub and was assisted right away. Grub hub called the driver and driver said he never got the food. Driver said KFC never made the food. Okay then I find it really odd, that I get a notification 1. Your order has been made. 2. You're order is on its way. 3. Track your order. 4. Your food has arrived!

So driver.. you're telling me you didn't pick up the food, however when you scan for pick up, it shows on my end.. and somehow it arrived but you never picked it up. Real fishy, and KFC doesn't even serve fish.

If I could give this no stars I would.

Grub hub delivery person had one tasty meal tonight. Never got my order. Now I wait 3-5 days for a refund.

This is a 3.5 rating .This KFC changed over the years. I will say there has been some renovations happened since the last 3 years or more since I haven't been here for years. I came to try the recent most talked about chicken sandwich on the market. The Donut chicken sandwich was okay. I did see improvements since I last stepped inside years ago. I may have to try some other item menus in the future since San Francisco are losing fast food joints over the years.

"This KFC has been a long-time fixture at the corner of 6th and Geary.  Over the course of time, the location has become a combination of KFC and Taco Bell.  Needing to bring some food over for a potluck, we decided to grab a bucket of chicken.

The menu board is split with Taco Bell on the left and KFC on the right. Focusing on KFC, we narrowed down our options and placed the order.  As I was paying, I could see the workers quickly packing my order and before my transaction was completed, my order was up and ready. It was good to see workers enthusiastic with their jobs and getting it done promptly. Great service!  Oh the order was properly filled and the chicken was tasty.

Bad rap.

Sometimes timing is everything.  And when I'm craving for those old style Mickey D's fried apple pies.... Well, I guess that's why I'm writing this review.  

In the beginning, this was a convenient pit stop with their convenient parking lot for about nine cars for my food run from a nearby Chinese restaurant.  However, feeling guilty about using their lot without actually buying anything here drew me to study their menu and buy a snack, meal, or drink to soften that guilt.

With the merger of Taco Bell and KFC, the menu is pretty extensive so it shouldn't be difficult to find something to your liking.  My normal go-to snacks are their cole slaw (small or large portions) side and crispy Taco Supreme that I'd load up with a variety of their hot sauces.  
However, in having a occasional sweet tooth, I noticed their apple turnovers on the dessert menu and tried this several years ago.  

Let's just say that this is my main reason to stop in as my family enjoys these just as much, if not more, as me.  I often order six to eight of these as my family often eats one upon arrival and reheats another for the next day's breakfast or a snack for later.

The cashiers are very nice and make things very easy.  Isn't that how fast food is supposed to go?  If you enjoy the old time fast food choices (where are those Happy Meals again... darn you SF?!) like me, try the apple turnovers and tell me what you think.  By the way, the Mickey D's in Hawaii still cook them the old way so this saves me five hours of flying.","Mike C.

They claim they have those $5 fill ups just to make you come. every price is jacked up.for the price they have now you might as well eat at a restaurant. It's just not worth it anymore.

From the outside this KFC looks like a KFC you would see in Tokyo Japan. This KFC is alright. Not the cleanest KFC. After ordering my food. I went upstairs to find somewhere to sit and it was dirty at this setting area. So I moved to another table. That table and I chose. I saw an ant crawling on the table. I killed it with my fingers and sat down. Lastly it took awhile to order because the person in front of me was taking too long to order and no one was opening up a second register. That's not right.

Last week, a security guard at my work was eating fried chicken and boy, the smell was ssooo gooood.  So, I got a chance and stopped by this KFC at 4150 Geary blvd. few days ago at 9:49pm to buy a bucket of chicken thighs n legs and the lady at the counter told me they only got wings left.  It was not 10pm yet, which is their closing time.  I felt that they were just lazy to make for me.
Back in the days, leftover chicken would not be used for the next day, but nowadays, they can reuse to make patties for your chicken sandwiches, so there, just lazy staffs.

Service was great and fast - the order was complete and accurate - there is plenty of spacious seating on the second floor. Not so much on the ground level- I say if you come in here you have to order and walk upstairs witch is not a bad thing because you get a great view of Geary Blvd. Very clean upstairs and food is always greasy and good  
I would recommend to stock up the upstairs station with napkins and other essentials and to clean the lower level a little more so it looks more appealing and professional -
But over all not a bad place to grab a quick lunch.
You always have to remember this is not a 5 star dining local it's a fast food chain-

We ordered a $20 bucket fill up. Which Includes 8 pieces of chicken and some sides. Now is it me, or is the chicken pieces getting smaller and smaller. I asked for dark meat and there were four drumsticks and four thighs. When I opened up the box, I thought it was four wings. Seriously, why are these thighs the side of a chicken wing?? And the drumsticks were small too. I've ordered KFC at other locations and their pieces were the normal side. About the palm of an adult hand. But these pieces of small chicken, were like chicken tenders small. Did they pick small pieces for me? Or is KFC shrinking their chicken for maximum profit. Needless to say, out family of four wasn't were not happy with what we say. Lame

I've been coming to this location A LOT only because it's right by my dorm and it's open till 10 and sometimes I just need to eat something at 9, when everything else is closed...
As I'm waiting to order, I'm looking at the menu minding my own business. But me, being Mexican and all, overhears the kitchen people talking in Spanish. And I see this Hispanic lady leave the kitchen and go into the public bathroom which is by the soda machines. And she opens the door and it turns out that someone was inside (it's a one person bathroom), so she closes the door and says ""pendeja!"" To those of you who are non-Spanish speakers, that means ""dumbass!"" The person inside the bathroom was a customer.
Now, the person inside was at fault for not locking the door; however, that can happen to ANYONE. Sometimes people forget and it SUCKS when that happens. But, there was this white guy in line behind me, and with a white accent he asks the Hispanic lady ""Hay un problema?"" [EYE OON PRO-BLEH-MAH?] (Is there a problem?) That's right. The white guy understood the word ""pendeja."" And it turns out that the lady inside the bathroom is his waifu-chan (wife). She responds to the white guy saying ""Oh no, she jus' forgot tu lock da door"" and ran upstairs (the dining area is upstairs and I'm assuming she used the other bathroom up there). The lady comes out of the bathroom and it turns out she's Asian. Why does this matter? Oh you'll find out :P   Now, if you want to have this as your private conversation that's totally fine. But don't talk out loud like that. You never know when there's other people who are going to understand you. Or if there'll be another beaner there that understands the whole situation and ends up posting it on your Yelp. Seriously. But aside to watching out for Mexicans, there's LOTS of people that actually understand Spanish. Especially here in California. Kids these days learn it in high school. And in the workplace, you still have to maintain some amount of professionalism... even if you work at a Taco Bell/KFC place.... You definitely do not openly insult customers like that and you definitely don't openly laugh about it with your friends. That is very rude and highly disrespectful.
I probably won't be returning to this location anymore since I'm graduating, so I can live on without fear that they'll possibly spit in my food when they read this. Haha.
I'm giving this place 1-star because I thought that was very disrespectful and people need to be made aware that this type of behavior DOES happen inside this location.

So I order my food. And the guy that attended me (don't know his name) is REALLY NICE and he has great service skills. But when I'm done ordering, the Hispanic lady comes back down and she talks with her other Hispanic coworkers and says ""se estaba cagando la china!"" (The Chinese/Asian lady was taking a shit.) And like... I'm at the soda machine now and she's trying to get some soda too from inside the counter type of thing... and now, she probably thought I was white because she was just talking with her friends rudely about the Asian lady as if it doesn't matter that she'll be heard. And so, I tell her in Spanish twice ""Ten cuidado, te van entender"" (be careful because they're gonna understand you). And she kinda seemed shocked because she didn't reply and she walked further away to a corner but kept talking.

YES! I'm FUCKING GOING THERE. Sure, try to tell me that this completely throws my credibility out the window, but KFC's my jam. Who doesn't deep down like themselves some oh-ree-hen-ELL recipe chicken, with their bomb cole slaw, and those biscuits that still blow away the biscuits at some of those hoity toity soul food for rich folks places that are so hip these days? Yeah, they totally do brown gravy made from one of those powder packets at the grocery store, but, that's one of the reasons why I don't give them a full 5 stars (other reason I will allude to later).
Y'all complaining about soggily breaded chicken? Well, you're doing it all wrong, then. You have to eat the chicken THERE, at the KFC, and bask in the magic of their chicken at its full crispy potential. No fried chicken's going to be able to maintain its crispiness after sitting in a bucket where all of the steam from the chicken clings to your chicken bucket lid and then falls back onto the chicken (try it with Front Porch chicken...just try....it will come out just as soggy skinned). You eat it fresh, it's everything you want in a fried chicken: crispy, salty, and (YES, their catchphrase) FINGER LICKIN' GOOD! Sure, the KFC restaurant itself meets the cleanliness standards of a Central Valley gas station off the I-5 bathroom floor (the other thing that bring them down a star), but sometimes for the yum, you have to make some sacrifices.

This location is convenient because the bus stop for the 38 and 38L is right outside.
I noticed the hours of operation on the door here and at a few other joint KFC/Taco Bell locations. These locations open until 10 pm or 11 pm which is a good thing for consumers. If you are craving for something to eat at 8 pm or 9 pm, this is the spot to turn to. I simply praise this and a few other restaurants partly because there aren't a lot of eateries open past 10 pm.

The bulk of my 2 star rating comes from the fact they get my order wrong EVERY TIME the manager is not on duty. There is always something missing, or something incorrect with the order without fail. When Jun or one of the other managers is on duty, my order is always correct.
I understand this is fast food, but that should also make the quality of the food pretty uniform. But I have had quality that varies greatly, sometimes the rice is hard & undercooked for example. Or the potato wedges are soggy and cold. Or the chips are broken into tiny pieces you can't really dip in the cheese sauce...
And while I love their new limeade drink (it's just Sierra Mist & a pump of lime syrup, but it's so tasty) but every time I have asked for it, the cashier doesn't know how to ring it, and they give me some drink, chips & salsa special which is not what I want. They need to call a manager to void it and help them find the right button. It's a bit annoying trying to decide if it's worth the hassle of ordering the drink I like or not.
Most of the staff are very nice and courteous so that's a plus. And the restaurant is usually clean and smells good. They have a small downstairs dining area (about 5 chairs only) but upstairs is very large and has a variety of booths, tables and bar-type seating. With a nice view of the corner of Geary & 6th. It's fun to people watch and see everyone getting on & off the bus below you.

OK...I had this Fried Chicken Fix today and KFC/Taco Bell was right there.  I've been so good for so long not eating any fast food except on rare occasions of convenience.  That being said...ordered a 3-piece Original Recipe chicken meal with a Root Beer ;).  It actually hit the spot, but they forgot my coleslaw.  So I had to return back to that counter for that.  The downstairs area seemed too crammed as the lunch time crowd just filled up and made it difficult to maneuver through.  I also must say that this location can use a good spic-and-span in the eating areas.  The dining area upstairs (which is fairly large) was not well kept and very dirty!  Not sure if they are under-staffed or under-managed, but that's pretty unacceptable.  For me, a fast food joint like a KFC/Taco Bell would get about 3 stars, but I have to ding this one today.

I am a longtime fan of TacoBell and have to have my fix every so often...I know every Taco Bell in every town I have ever lived.

Dirty, unkempt, slow and although the young manager was over the top fantastic and very professional, he is this KFC's only asset!

This is the WORST Taco Bell/KFC I've ever been to in the city, and I think I've been to almost all of them. Not only did they completely skimp on the fillings of my items (they gave about half the amount of meat & cheese that other Taco Bells do), but the restaurant was DISGUSTING and FILTHY. The outside of the front door was covered in who knows what, but I did NOT touch it with my bare hands. I should really have turned back at that point, but I claim temporary insanity.

More on the lack of cleanliness --the floors looked like they hadn't been mopped or swept or ANYTHING in about a month or longer. The bathroom smelled horrible and was dirty and gross. The dining room upstairs was ATROCIOUS... there was a huge pile of spilled soda just sitting on the floor, about 3 feet long by 1 foot wide. 90% of the tables hadn't been cleaned off, there was garbage on the floor, etc. I was completely appalled. If the rest of the restaurant looked like that, I don't want to even *think* about the health code violations going on in the kitchen.

I wrote to the corporate headquarters about this particular restaurant, and will definitely NOT be going back there.","

One thing I've learned, if you're gonna order fried chicken to go you have to let it breathe. Otherwise, you'll end up with steamed chicken skin no crunch!

Hello All,

This is my first Yelp comment, as my co-workers urged me to write this.  Our office wanted to celebrate Thanksgiving before we all go on vacation, but no one wanted to make a turkey; hence, our Thanksgiving turkey purchase at KFC.  I must say, I was hesitant, and thought, ""what the heck let's do it"".  Deep fried turkey sounds pretty darn good.  Needless to say the turkey was freaking awesome!  Everyone in my office thoroughly enjoyed the turkey, and everyone said, it was the best turkey they have ever eaten.  Kudos to KFC for doing turkey the right way.  BTW- it only took them 45 min to cook and they called me when it was done.

This review is not about the food.  I mean, it's Taco Bell/KFC.  They're all pretty much exactly the same, foodwise--the ingredients are all trucked in from the same faraway place.
But not all Taco Bell/KFCs are equal.  No, no, no.  This one has the distinction of being the most consistently filthy of all the TB/KFCs in the city.  And that's saying something, given that the others are not all that great.
The floor is DISGUSTING. Always. Upstairs and downstairs.  The walls are flecked with food bits.  The tables are always dirty.  Every single one of them.   I have never, ever seen anyone go upstairs and clean up the dining room.  Ever.  I am surprised I haven't seen rats and cockroaches crawling around.  (yet)

i only crave you when i'm drunk or pms-ing. luckily, when i'm pms-ing i have enough common sense to steer clear of the shit you serve. unluckily for you, i am usually only drunk past 10:00 p.m. when you are closed. i don't think this is gonna work.
best wishes,

Service inside was not not that bad. I was not empressed by the location appearance. Was kind of dirty and not fresh. I got some salad, mash potato and chicken to go and left. When I got to my location I noticed there was no salad , whaich was paid for. I will come back there just once more to get refund.

I went to KFC today because they were giving away pieces of their new Kentucky Grilled Chicken.  I'd been itching to try it, but not enough to pay $5 for a whole meal so today was perfect!  I went in, bought the new Black Jack taco (tasty - definitely worth 89 cents if you have a cheap taco craving) and got my freebie grilled chicken thigh.  It's basically fried chicken without the batter.  The skin is crispy, fatty and delicious.  The chicken is chicken.  I like that they have a parking lot.  It's a good place to go if you have a craving for KFC or Taco Bell

If you're going to insist on calling your customers by their name, you would do well to get it right.  And with this place, even when I spell it out for them, they STILL can't get it right.

Lately I've been ordering quite a bit from KFC/Taco Bell due to pure convenience and only a 5 min drive from the house. This location has always provided excellent customer service and never disappointed me in food quality. The last few times I've been here I've always gotten my food super quick and if I used any of the pickup services: Doordash/Ubereats/Eat 24, the food was ready to go when I arrived.
I usually get the extra crispy 3 piece chicken and fries. The staff here go the extra mile in terms of sauces for my order. If I'm not getting KFC then the tacos and burritos are also on point. I've gotten a couple of taco boxes these last few days and they're great for lunch.

I still enjoy having Kentucky Fried Chicken once in a while. This place was my old neighborhood KFC. The KFC original fried chicken is my favorite. I like a good breast piece.

I normally don't stop for foods like this but this fast food Taco Bell/KFC is one of the best run fast food places I've seen in the US. This place is on par with ones I've been to internationally in Asia which is a pretty high praise. Whoever is the manager here is pretty competent, give him/her a medal!!!

I say that this is one of the better KFC huts liberally but its true. Place is cleaned regularly, the staff actually care about what they're doing, and stuff like paper straws upon requests are nice touches that make this place better than others.

The plus is they had Taco Bell as well. Golden State Warriors games were playing on the TVs. The place is bright inside, and even during the dinner rush we were in, everything was efficient af.

Overall, 5/5 for fast food.

I looove the mashed potatoes from KFC as well as their chocolate cake! So good! They have a lot of seating here as well as a TV which most of the time shows sports. One thing that's a bit off is how unclean it may be at times? There was once where the trash was overfilled and no one did anything about it. Same with the tables, but that's on the customers.

I'm a big KenTacoHut fan. When I found out KFC would come to my door, I had to try out the service. I was looking for on time delivery and wondering if the breading would stay crispy. My orders came a few minutes early. The food retained its separate temperatures; my cole saw didn't warm up in transit. The chicken was crispy   The one thing I suggest is to write in your order that you don't need plates and sporks. Defaulting to sending out a spork is fine, but there should be a checkbox if you don't need plates.

I went to this KFC once before they closed for remodeling.  I ordered two Burritos Supremes.  I thought my order was a relatively simple one.  I got home  and opened the bag to find only one Burrito Supreme and one regular burrito.  I called the restaurant immediately and spoke to the manager, telling her about the mistake.  She told me to bring the receipt back for a refund or a Burrito Supreme.  She also told me to go ahead and eat the regular burrito.

I put the regular burrito in the freezer and brought it back to KFC the next week.  I showed the manager the receipt clearly showing I ordered and paid for two Burritos Supremes.  She apologized and offered me tacos or an extra Burrito Supreme to make up for the inconvenience of returning to the restaurant.  I said no and that I only wanted what I paid for.

She went to the back and came back after a few minutes.  She handed me a bag and told me she included a taco salad to make amends.  I told her that I only wanted the Burrito Supreme but she was insistent that I take the taco salad as well.  She apologized again for their mistake and told me to come back.

I think the reason this place is so good is the management (I think the managers name is Rosa). She's got her shit down. All the staff are SUPER friendly and accommodating. I ask for the toppings of my nachos supreme on the side and they give me what I want with NO attitude whatsoever (lol I'm always good high maintenance).

"Whenever i come here, i usually get the tacos  since its also a taco bell....and sometime their hot wings. Came here last week to buy some food for the family for dinner since we were too busy to cook something. Of course we got the 12 tacos supreme since it includes tomatoes and sour cream. $17.99 for the 12 supreme tacos. Quite expensive for that amount of taco, its still good even though the shells arent always crunchy. I always enough their tacos.

But my brother and i decided to also get the fried chicken meal instead of the hot wings since it has been so many years, maybe over a decade, since we had their fried chickens and their side dishes meal. We had the 20 pieces of fried chicken, 4 biscuits, 1 coleslaw, 2 mash potatoes , and 1 gravy for $20 before tax...decent price. The skin of chicken were more on the soggy side. It doesnt taste crispy enough but still good. Their coleslaw are always good like how i remember from the last time i had it. Biscuit can be more on bland side it doesnt have the buttery flavor like how popeyes does it so that is why they give you packs of butter. Mash potatoes and gravy are average

Service is so-so.

I barely go to this location because I usually frequent the one on Ocean ave. But this evening I decided to come here since I went grocery shopping next door to Manila Oriental.
Tonight I ordered my usual 2 chicken thighs, mild and original. Something I should always do before leaving the restaurant is check my bag. I made that mistake today and as soon as I got home I was welcomed with a spicy and crispy chicken thigh and leg. Usually I would be driving back there have my food replaced and complain but I was too tired. But it wouldn't have made a difference.

Seasonal holiday cajun turkey = 2 stars!

KFC's cajun deep fried turkey is overrated and overpriced (must prepay: $59.99 alone, or $79.99 with mashed potato, gravy, cole slaw, and biscuits). Worth only 2 stars, because the breast meat was dry, only the dark meat was still moist. And the ""cajun"" spices smelled like chemicals.

Their method of deep frying did nothing to improve it over well made standard roasted turkey. I don't know how this store managed to overcook the deep fried turkey. Maybe the turkey wasn't brined beforehand, Either they cooked it for too long, or it was fried a second time to serve it warm. For the price, I expect to get perfectly cooked turkey, not an overcooked one.

I recommend going to an Asian supermarket to buy a cheaper standard roasted turkey instead (for example: Pacific Supermarket for $36.88, or 99 Ranch Market for $45.88, which includes gravy and a side dish). Not as good as my uncle's homemade roasted turkey (better than KFC), but you'll be saving some money.

No complaints about their regular KFC and Taco Bell fast food menu = worth 3 stars.
Although this location doesn't have a drive thru, it's one of the most popular KFC stores in SF (other than the 6th Ave store), and service is usually quick and pleasant (4 stars). Also has 2 large wall mounted LCD TV screens playing sports.

I haven't had many problems with this KFC. The chicken had been really small on many occasions however, but it mostly because the grilled pieces shrink up during the 'grilling'. I've been meaning to check other KFCs to see if this was the common trend.

A KFC with no drive through and a small lot is an unhappy KFC.
It always pains me to give KFC a low review because this is one of my favorite food..ever! No shame. But this KFC is located in a sometimes sketchy area. Lines can get long. Chicken pieces are super tiny. Chicken strips are very hard and dry. 50% of the time they mess up your order somehow and you end up going home with a :( face because your $5 box is missing a biscuit..or cookie...
The pain. Except for the Tuesday 2 pieces for $1.99 deal, I wouldn't recommend coming here. Although props to the workers for dealing with some very difficult customers at time. Oh, and you can get Taco Bell food here too.

Yeah I know 5 stars for KFC? Well...here is why. I used go to the Ocean Ave. KFC but I ended up at this branch by accident one night and thank goodness for that. First of all the first night we went in they not only did they get our entire order right and complete (something you really have to watch out for especially at the Taraval St. location) but they gave us a little extra. I won't say what for fear that heads could roll. We noticed how much better the chicken tasted. Sometimes chicken from KFC looks like it got beat with a hammer, broken bones, all ripped up. Well we got fresh, whole, large pieces. Also when we went in to the location we saw how well lit the kitchen was. All lit up. I swear if you go to the Ocean Ave. location the kitchen is so dark. They look like they are having séances back there. Not only was the place well lit but I noticed that they had received a 100% on their health inspection. And if that wasn't enough the staff. The staff is so competent. They know what they are doing and some of them have been there for a long time. They are friendly, competent, the orders are complete, and nothing is too much trouble for them. We drive  quite a ways out of our way to get to this pleasant chicken provider.  We  also have finally figured out what to order from KFC. We don't mess with the legs or thighs. We only order the breasts. They cost a dollar more but they are as big as two thighs and they are not as greasy. They taste SOOOO much better than the other. They also have two large flat screens that are always playing sports. Well that's about it. Give this place a try

Believe it or not, door dash limits your KFC order to under 100$ and their order was $106. In order to please this office, I wanted to go above and beyond and deliver it myself. She assured me she could do it but needed an hour heads up. I called 10 minutes before they opened (11am) Wednesday and she answered. I was blown away. The order was ready within the hour. While I waited inside KFC for them to bag the order, I was extremely impressed with her ability to put her customers in line from behind the counter.

KFC? Yes darlings. When you are tired and just want to get dinner on the table, no need to call for takeout. No need to microwave whatever frozen thing you know won't look in real life like it does on the box.
Get your  rice cooker, some uncooked rice, chicken bone broth, spices, and nestle that KFC chicken on top of the rice then start the cycle and voila! Tender chicken, beautifully seasoned rice and all of that took little effort and less than 20 minutes!
Dress it with green onions and your home made chili oil and your home made kimchi. Your family will love it and you will feel happy you fed them well.
YouTube is your friend if you are not skilled in the kitchen for recipes and tutorials.
This KFC location has staff in protective wear with carry-out option that is super easy and fast. Grab a 3 piece box of chicken on your way home and try the rice cooker situation.

I mean this place pre-Rona was a total dump. Dirty, greasy and dusty. Now, I must say, it's finally clean. The floor, the countertops, it's like a degreaser/Lysol mushroom cloud exploded in this joint. Only thing is u walk in & you are blasted with some hot ass air from above the front door. Why this air and where's it coming from? But, alas, my to-go order has never been correct. Last visit an overweight woman behind the counter came out yellin and covered in flour from neck to waist. She was screeching to the uber eats and deliver drivers to back up from the counter. ( FYI they weren't even close ) My thoughts were maybe if you got the food ready and on time there wouldn't be 8 people waiting to pick up nasty KFC. My chicken breast was literally inedible, rest of the chicken was ok. The Taco Bell portion was great. Guy in the back making the tacos was super fast, even though flour covered lady was yelling at them. The football game was on so waiting was on for the moment.

The order arrived lightning fast, which was great--plus they do delivery from Yelp app, huzzah! But sadly my experience wasn't incredible. I guess I should have known? As much as I know many fast food places can put lots of love and care into their food, often I've found they don't and the marketing is nothing like the real thing. (Duh, I know.)
Anyway, I was craving fried chickeen so ordered on a whim. They missed out two of the sides I requested. I didn't fully comprehend how small the sides were, so those two missing ones meant I had much less food that I would have preferred. The quality of the chicken wasn't amazing. (Small pieces, a little overcooked for my preference.)
All in all, I imagine more value in putting in a large family order with several vs trying to scratch a fried chicken itch for one.

I went to order the popcorn chicken that they currently have a promotion on. 70 pieces for $10. I asked 2 separate associates and even showed them a picture of the promo. They assured me that was what I will be getting. So I place an order for 2 of the promo. They asked if I could wait while they cook up some more popcorn chicken. I said sure not a problem. About 10-15 later my order was ready. I should have known better and double checked my order at the restaurant because when I got home and opened up the boxes. It was nothing close to 70 pieces. Maybe if I added both boxes together there might have been 70. KFC your prices have been going up while your quality have definitely been going down. I've been a KFC fan for almost 35 years. I've tried to turn the other cheek over the past decade, but I think this last visit is the one that broke the camel's back. Thank you for the memories but peace out.

Well, sometimes one desires to order from KFC every once in a while.  I must admit that this is the only location for miles.  It's been in the neighborhood for decades actually & has been there for our long ago picnics when our son was a baby and over the subsequent years.

With COVID-19 and SIP orders in our immediate lives nowadays delivery is the best way to go when ordering food.  KFC is one of the BEST in delivery at least here in the vicinity of this location.  It's via Grubhub & we've always had our orders prepared and delivered immediately.  The delivery people are always great.

The chicken and sides have always been hot and fresh.  So no complaints there.

However, there is one negative point:  Price per side.  The photos of the sides are misleading for the 'small' sizes.  Be aware that for $3.09 per mashed potato it's one of those teeny tiny red plastic containers you'll receive.  Same with the corn @ $3.99 each.  Very very expensive for what it is.  They need to lower the prices of these as it's way to exorbitant!

How does Kentucky fried chicken run out of chicken at 9pm when they close at 10pm? Chicken is literally part of your name. I'm sure there was more chicken but they didn't want to fry it in case it turns out to be a waste since it's towards the end of the night. I get it but there was still people coming in and lining up at 9pm. Settled for hot wings and a chicken sandwich. The hot wings were old, over cooked/fried and sad. Chicken sandwich is no where near on par with jolliebee, Popeyes or chick-fil-a. This isn't the first time I've gotten crappy food at this location.

Started coming here when the price of a chicken and biscuit was less than $2.00. But had to stop after getting food poisoning from something. Then I remember when I waited in line for the $1 Tuesday specials which quickly moved to $1.69.

The only negative about the KFC Taraval is that parking bites most of the time and so does the traffic safety. Even though there's a designated and marked pedestrian crosswalk, cars come speeding though when you are trying to walk from one corner to the other, barely missing you sometimes! I mean, what kind of rush can a driver accomplish by speeding through an intersection only to have to stop at a red light that's 1/2 block up?!?!?!

Can't a girl get some KFC?  Seriously!  

I take my precious pup to the optometrist on Taraval and this particular KFC is across the street.  Twice I have gone in (against my better judgment) I made an effort to get me some greasy fried chicken.  And twice now I have stood at the counter waiting for the staff behind the counter to 1. acknowledge me and 2. take my order; I was not acknowledged therefore no order was taken.  Really?  What is up with that?

The first time I went in, albeit, I was not patient (parking meter was running out of time), I gave them a minute to at least acknowledge my presence -- I was ignored.  Piece, I'm out; and I do mean piece as in piece of chicken.

This last time (and I do mean LAST time) I allotted myself extra time and put more money in the parking meter because I knew it was going to take some time to 1. be acknowledged and 2. give my order and wait for the meal.

Inside the restaurant there was a family of three in front of me and no one else.  The family ordered their meals and the young man behind the counter took their order/money and told them it would be about 10 minutes.  

I'm observing the other staff in the back behind a monstrosity that looks like a set up station and figured they would be the ones to put together the order while the young man continues to take another order; my order.  I was wrong.  

While standing at the counter for what felt like forever I was completely ignored by the young man taking orders and the three staff members behind the monstrosity.  

Slowly the young man started to put together the orders from the family ahead of me.  Let me tell you, he moved slower than molasses.  During this time not once did he look up to acknowledge my presence and/or say I'll be right with you, instead, he continued to move slow and steady processing the orders in what appeared as he didn't know the menu.  

I painfully watched this display for about 7+ minutes while his co-workers moved just as slow in the back going on about doing nothing.

My time is precious, the parking meter is running out and well, like that, I'm out too.  And never to return because, in the 7+ forever minutes I stood there I noticed how dirty and dingy this KFC looked and well, I'm not sure what their health inspection score is but I can bet it's 80% or lower.  

Just an observation.

Ugh I do not understand all of the 2-star reviews. Are you rating based on quality of food? Nutritional value? Customer service? You're at KFC/Taco Bell, y'all. If you're looking for fine dining at KFC/Taco Bell then you're going to have a bad time.5 stars because:
1.) they have parking lot (small but FREE PARKING)
2.) they are FAST. Seriously. I come here a lot and I never have to wait more than a few minutes for my food.

After blowing into the city after a short flight from San Diego, I crossed paths with this KFC advertising their Tuesday special of 2-pieces of chicken for $0.99.  Never one to turn down a good deal, I dropped in and ordered 4 orders, totaling 8 pieces of chicken.

I got 4 of the regular, 2 extra crispy, and 2 grilled pieces of chicken.  Since the turnover was so high during the busy day, the chicken was very fresh and piping hot.  My favorites were the original and grilled but I found that much of the oil had not drained from the extra crispy, making it a very oily eating experience.  Overall though, it's a great price for a decent fast food meal.

This binge session probably didn't do my diet much good and is making all of the exercise for naught.  But hey, I can't keep eating boring old salads can I?  Maybe once in a while isn't so bad.  I can't wait till next Tuesday!

I've been coming to this KFC since high school was just up the block. Boy, has it change since then. I would come in every so often and notice it has be on a down fall.

Last Saturday was the last straw. I came in during the dinner rush so I was already expecting it to be a little slow. But, 30 MINUTES for 12 piece meal slow?!?! I only noticed 4 workers. 2 in the back and 2 in the front. The young asian girl who took my order was on point though and was hauling ass placing orders and packing orders. The other young asian dude, not so much. Seem like he was trying to spit game at his girl co-worker the whole time and moving super slow packing orders. He had alot to say to his co-work, but not a word to me when he handed me my order finally. No Thank You no nothing. Asked him for KFC hot sauce, and just pointed to the empty sauce tray. Told him their out, he mean mugged me and grabbed some from under the counter and just tossed it into the tray. If I wasn't with my 2 kids and 10 years younger, I would of slapped the S**T out of him.

Also, wassup with them allowing all the homeless people to take up half of the store? There were 3 of them but had so many bags that took up the whole corner of the store (keep in mind the store isn't that big in the first place). Also had 3 big suitcases and bags blocking the entrance. I don't mine if they eat there, their paying customer as well, but have them leave their stuff outside or something. It was during dinner rush hour, there were no room for other customers to stand around waiting for their order to be SLOWLY made.

Extra star went to the young asian girl working the front. Will I be back, probably, but Popeye's will be my first option.

This is the first one star review I have given, and there are many legitimate reasons. First of all, it's not like this restaurant is understaffed, but the service is just extremely slow. I waited in a two person line for around twenty minutes, and there were five staff members and a manager present. I was pretty relieved when I finally got my food, but then, I realized: the chicken tenders were stale, and the manager, without realizing it said oh, those are the mashed potatoes from lunch. This was at dinner time and they looked and tasted horrible. I am not happy about the service and the food here. I  hope this is the only time this will happen. Finally, all the menu prices are inconsistent, and there are no more daily deals or anything

The KFC I frequent the most is the one on Irving and and 20th Ave.  Until the chicken got bad.  I posted a review on yelp about that same location.  

So I decided to try out this location on Traval street.  I purchased the two piece thigh/leg special for $1.49 on Tuesday.  Same cost as the other location.  What a HUGE difference.  The chicken pieces are bigger than the Irving street one.  Nice golden color and not dark brown.  And no greasy dark brown oil on the bottom of the bucket like that of Irving street.  I took a bite into the Spicey Chicken and it tasted good!  As if I've never eaten real KFC in the past.  Now THIS is how KFC chicken is supposed to taste like.  Not the half-ass chicken that the Irving Street location serve.  

I would have given this location a five star.  Mainly because the few times I've went to this location, one of the employees scares the hell out of me.  She's a larger African American woman, named Paulette, working the counter taking the orders.   She's never done anything to me personally.  But the few times I've been there, she's always yelling or barking at her employees.  A few times, she'll be doing the same to the customer.  Like a Drill Sargent talking really LOUD!  I'm sure she's just in the zone barking the same questions to the customers.  ""DO YOU WANT ORIGINAL, SPICEY or CRISPY!!!""  And she does it LOUD!!!  I watch where while standing in line and it freaks and confuses the customers sometimes.  When I get up to there, I make my order to the point.  ""I want an order of the Tuesday special in original to go""... Then she'll bark, ""HOW MAN ORDERS?!""  (I already told her an order), so I say, just one order.  Then she'll bark, ""DO YOU WANT ORIGINAL, SPICEY or CRISPY!!!"" (i already told her original) so I tell her again, original.  Then she asks, ""FOR HERE OR TO GO?!!""... Dude... you're taking orders... You REALLY need to listed to the customers instead of barking all the time.  She's like the Soup Nazi from the Seinfeld show.  Mean as hell.

Other that that, the chicken in this location us finger lickin' good!

So after I turned in my Oprah coupon at Irving Street, I took my other coupon and ran over to Taraval Street.  The chicken here was a lot bigger.  Like twice as big.  You'd think they'd get a standard size of chicken, but I guess not.  But the line was also twice as big, probably since Lincoln high is right around the corner.  No surprises there.

And the manager?  Man, you could tell she was in the zone.  She was barking orders to her team, and even the people in line, like a drill sergeant.  If anything, it was kind of funny.  I mean, it is KFC after all.

Anyway, I guess I have a lot more to say about this KFC other than the free chicken.  I've been going to this KFC for almost 20 years now.  I can't even believe that I can say that about any place, let along about a fast food restaurant.  All the finger-lickin' memories.  Hanging here with a jr. high school buddy on hot summer days.

Ok, guys.  I'd like to share something. My name is Lisa X. And I have a problem...I'm addicted to Tuesday chicken specials.  No matter where it is, KFC or Popeye's you'll see me there every Tuesday. I think one week I strayed away from those delicious fried suckers, but I always seem to find my way to them (or it the other way around?).

This branch always has a long line and I always see the usual Tuesday suspects. It's one of the smaller KFC/Taco Bells I've seen. Being a chain, you get the same stuff you see in all stores so I won't go into detail about all the happenings here. Here are some things to look out for:
-they run out of chicken fast so if you want a certain kind (grilled, crispy, or original) be prepared to have an alternate
-there are only like ten seats so you might as well take your grub home
-there's no restroom
-sometimes they don't have chicken pot pie (this made me sad one week)

Other than that, this is the usual KFC. The two guys that run the registers are pretty nice.  They're nicer than most fast food cashiers if you ask me.  If anyone needs a chicken buddy on Tuesday, hit me up,

10 piece chicken bucket
5 corn on a cobb
5 biscuits
2lbs mash potatoe w/gravy

We asked for original, but they were out......he said we should wait 10mins, because it is worth the wait, it will be REALLY fresh.  So we decided to wait, and he gave us 2 free drinks because we were so understanding.  :D  I think HE was the understanding one.  I sipped on strawberry Fanta as we waited and it was faster than expected. Then before we left, the manager shook my mom's hand, and thanked her again for her patience.

I was very disappointed in this KFC. I used to think it was fine but now I just cannot tolerate the bad customer service and how they make the food here. The last time I ordered a chalupa the outside was nearly burned! I never had an almost burned chalupa before. Way to ruin one of my favorite foods. I ordered tacos supreme and some other item with chicken, a side mashed potatoes and a biscuit. This lady was rude and not at all friendly. So I'm guessing they don't care about customers. Also I saw this other lady who threw my nachos in the bag like they weren't going to crack. So rough.

When i was really young, my grandma used to push me in a stroller down and around Lincoln High School, sometimes when i was a good boy she would push me down to KFC and get me a chicken little.

Boy i loved those chicken littles, they were small and simple. This was probably the only reason why i enjoyed KFC, unfortunetley they took those away and tried to bring it back but failed quite horribly..

I remember trying it again and realized how dry and tastless they were..i wish i never went back to try it~ o well at least the memories of how wonderful it tasted still lingers in my mind~

my grandpa likes fried chicken...unfortunetly there are no Popeyes close by so hes only been able to enjoy KFC...but its always a great time whenever I bring some KFC over. Funny how these places can bring back lots of memories~ *sniff*

Imma be fat if my boyfriend doesn't stop craving kfc!!! T____T

It's really close to home and supposedly has better spicy fried chicken than other places. The workers are really nice and probably remember us by now cuz we go so often :X

They have great deals in random days and ( if you like those honey BBQ wings) you can ask them to dip ur chicken in BBQ sauce and they'll do it at no extra cost! Awesomeee

Parking is easy too

I mean who isn't a sucker for fried chicken.  I mean really.  Don't even try to tell me you don't sometimes have one of those days were you want to just consume deep fried meat products.  

But damn this KFC for existing.  I shouldn't be able to satisfy my fried chicken craving so easily.  It's frustrating to have the lack of my will power always being rubbed in my face with each new bite of delicious golden fried goodness.

Oh and no KFC, I don't want grilled chicken.  Don't you know me, I thought we had been through some things over the years.  You know I like it fried.  Hot and fried.  How dare you.

I come here every other week, I can eat  fried chicken all the time and it's easier than having to cook. The girls (Paulette and Iris) runs this place like nobody's business. Came in once  when the Lincoln kids were having lunch and couldn't believe how quickly Iris and Paulette got everyone in and out. Another time, a homeless person was in line before me and Paulette treated him like an old friend with kindness and respect. BTW, the fried chicken is not bad either. Love the HOT WINGS.  I alternate between Popeye's and KFC but every time I come here, I feel like I'm visiting with friends and I get to bring home fried chicken.

I've had this conversation a few times, and I was wondering, how can this place be so stinky? My boyfriend claims that there is a runoff of ""kitchen fluids"" (ie chicken guts, grease, sweat, taco bell hot sauce) that are washed away from the restaurant and down out the side and into the street, which happens to be right next to our apartment. Yuck! Eat here if you must, but walking through the Mist of Stink is the first battle you must fight. The rest come later.

Peace out, Taco Bell/KFC.

They're usually friendly here, but the food is so-so.  Maybe it's because I get here pretty late at night, but they're usually out of Extra Crispy chicken. Last night, my mac & cheese was pretty burnt (scraped from the bottom of the pan) and it was this bright fluorescent orange color!  Another time I was here, they were out of chicken (?!?) and had to wait 15 minutes for them to cook a new batch.

Plus 1 star for actually have a smile on their face.  That's definitely a rarity for fast food workers.

Really Nice Folks working there. The lady at the register is really friendly and the staff tries their best to help you.

Why are people giving them 3 stars for Good rating. I was going to give them 4 stars but since people are giving this store middle or low scores just for being a KFC or Fast Food. What do you expect! It's a freaking Fast Food Chain. BTW, this store has a Tuesday deal vs some stores that don't in SF.

This. Place. Needs. To. Go!
I do from time to time enjoy me some fast food, however this place does not fit in with the rest of the neighborhood. I get that it serves Lincoln high school and all, but there are much better LOCAL options within a block of this place. All KFC does for the block is generate trash, because per ""corporate"" policy, they are not allowed to put trash cans outside their business (I have a sneaking suspicion it has more to do with laziness). I think this location could be better used as a locally owned anything.

And that is my mini KFC rant.

"First to Review
I go to this KFC only to buy food for someone in Ocean Beach area.
This store is small. It has small parking lot on the side of the building which will fit like 4 cars. The entrance is on Taraval St. westbound with the exit to the cross street of Taraval St.
The place does not have actual dining tables, only some kind of bar table against the wall.
One time I bought steak taquito, the cash register person did not know what taquito is (she's Latina!) but did not bother to confirm my order and got me beef taco.
Then when I complained that that beef taco was not what I ordered, she looked at me funny and another employee who apparently knew what taquito was, demanding me to pay another $2 because the steak taquito was supposed to be more expensive than the steak taco.
She took the $2 but did not ring it to the cash register.
What a loser! They did not even apologize.
Yesterday they did not have original wings and if I still wanted them I had to wait for 20 minutes. They did not have baked beans also.
Well, I used to work for a KFC (find my review for other KFC). When the employees make mistake, first, they are supposed to be apologetic then fix the problem without charging more.

UPDATE: the tuesday special is now 2 pieces for $1.49 (used to be 99 cents). They also have a monday and wednesday special of 2 pieces of chicken, corn, mash potatoes, and a biscuit for $2.99. Still a good change of pace in terms of fast food.

2 for $1 leg and thigh on tuesdays. Thats all I have to say. It might only be a SF promotion so I would take advantage of it. (they also have geary and irving locations) I would rather go here than popeyes (which also has the 2 for 1 deal at least in Stockton)

No the best place to eat but it's decent. Just avoid the school crowd during 12 noon. can't go wrong with $0.99 chicken deal!

just check your order. you order the original they give you crispy. the fat black lady got an attitude. I just want to bitch slap her sometimes.

When I moved to this neighborhood I was delighted to find out that there was a KFC only a short distance away. I was moving from the Tendernob and I absolutely hated venturing into the Tenderloin to get to the KFC within it.

This KFC is right in front of a stop of the L train (22nd & Taraval), so if I'm coming home from downtown it's damn hard to resist getting off at that stop for some KFC. Unfortunately the food here is pretty meh. I'd say it's standard KFC food, but I swear it's as if they specifically order the tiniest chicken strips they can. The side dishes are laughable as well and really aren't worth getting. It's not because they're bad, but because they're served in some of the tiniest plastic containers I've ever seen. I see there's already a picture of one listed here. I'm far from an environmentalist but all that plastic for what must be less than 6 teaspoons of mashed potatoes is ridiculous. I've been to KFCs out of state in the past and I know some KFCs serve MUCH bigger portions.
But, if you're in the mood for KFC, this will satisfy you I suppose. My only other complaint is that there are always a number of flys inside to make sure you're always paranoid and watching your food carefully so they don't land. I guess there isn't much they can do about the flys but it's probably best to order your food to go if you care about them.
